High level approach
=======================

- Use Urllib library in Python to read the HTML from the data files
- Parse the data
- Extract numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file
- Look for span tags and pull out the text content of the span tag
- Like the following: <tr><td>Modu</td><td><span class="comments">90</span></td></tr>
- Convert them to integers and add them up.


Note: Use BeautifulSoup to make your work easier. Regular expressions for extracting data from HTML pages is a nightmare!
